1. Should divide into multiple files: .c, .h respectively to their function
	
	+ .h: need use: 
		-	#ifndef CGI_H_INCLUDED
			#define CGI_H_INCLUDED
				...
			#endif 

			to avoid include multi header files

		-   Declare all global variables will use in .c files respectively, declare functions
		-	Not include others headers
		-	Think header file is just a dictionary, so we just the same as class in c++
		- 	When write header think it as global and any c source can include it and use
		- 	With struct: struct name;
		-	Define variables first then functions 

	+ Name of header and c source should the same, mostly
